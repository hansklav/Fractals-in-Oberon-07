# Several types of Spirals

Although spirals aren't fractals both are seen in living and lifeless nature, e.g. in ammonites and galaxies. Many spirals have self-similar properties, 
just like fractals. 

Already Archimedes (287-212 BCE) studied spirals and one kind of spiral is named after him: the 
[Archimedean or arithmetic spiral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_spiral). 
The grooves of a gramophone record and the turns of a rolled ribbon are examples of Archimedean spirals.
The modules ArchiSpiral0.Mod and ArchiSpiral.Mod are based on SPIRAL.BAS.

The [evolvent or involute of a circle](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Parametric_Equation_of_Involute_of_Circle) (Dutch: 'wikkellijn, afwikkelkromme') is another kind of spiral. It can be constructed by the end of an unwinding string wound around a cilinder.
See WIKKEL.BAS and Evolvent.Mod.
