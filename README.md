# Fractals-in-Oberon-07

This repository contains Oberon source code to draw several fractals. <br>
All fractals make use of XYgraphics.Mod (in this repo) and also of XYplane.Mod and Math.Mod (in my repo Oberon-07).

Be sure to use the corrected [Math.ln(x)](https://github.com/hansklav/Oberon-07-Math.ln) if you use this function in the implementation of [Math.power(x, e)](https://github.com/hansklav/Oberon-07/blob/master/Math.Mod).
